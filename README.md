# Project Objective:

Develop and run scripts for “TokenizedBallot.sol” to:

- give voting tokens,
- delegating voting power,
- casting votes,
- checking vote power
- querying results

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to run scripts to mint new ERC20 Tokens which use standard OpenZeppelin contracts to obtain voting rights and vote using a modified version of the "Tokenised Ballot" Example in the Solidity Docs.

# Details

Using the “**Solidity By Example”** `Ballot.sol` as the basis for a Ballot contract (code can be found [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/solidity-by-example.html)), create an ERC20 voting token using OpenZeppelin to enable users to cast votes for specific proposals in a ballot contract.

# Requirements

Develop and run scripts for `TokenizedBallot.sol` to perform the following:

- Give voting tokens (Mint Tokens)
- Delegating voting power
- Casting votes
- Checking vote power
- Querying results

# Yamato:

Yamato refers to the ancient historical period and clan in Japan, often associated with the early imperial rule and the foundation of the Japanese state. This name draws inspiration from Asian history and carries a sense of tradition and cultural significance
