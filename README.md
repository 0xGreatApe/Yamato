# Project Objective:

Develop and run scripts for “TokenizedBallot.sol” to:

- give voting tokens,
- delegating voting power,
- casting votes,
- checking vote power
- querying results

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to run scripts to mint new ERC20 Tokens which use standard OpenZeppelin contracts to obtain voting rights and vote using a modified version of the "Tokenised Ballot" Example in the Solidity Docs.
